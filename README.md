  ##### You can reach me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-noble-webb/) 
## Overview
  The basis of this project was to demonstrate the software engineering skills I learned from Flatiron's 15-week program. The base of this *Javascript React* application was created in ~3-weeks and has an accompanying *Ruby* backed titled _Empowered_People_API_ where it pulls and stores data. It host extinct animals dating back over aprx. 440 million years ago and is one of the earliest users of [BonkersJS](https://github.com/thesebonesalone/BonkersReact) game engine. Currently you will need to fork both the front and backend to run this application, but soon that it will be online! 
 
## Why this specific application?
There are three major factors that lead me to create this application:
  1. To encrich and empower people by providing fun, reliable, and judgement free information
  2. To challenge my pre-concieved limitations
  3. To fulfill a lifelong dream
 
## Features
  * +300 extinct animal data points compiled into cards
  * Interactive game scape meant to mirror the ranges these animals once roamed
  * Master and User Tile Map Editors
  * jwt secured

## What's Next? 
  * Data based trivia game
  * Quest and Damage intergration to interactive aspect
  * +200 animals along with plants!!
  * User installation of maps

## Known Bugs (2/9/21)
  * Lower and right most quardrents of interactive aspect span beyond available tiles
  * Small glitches when retrieving an animal's description if another animal holds the same tile
  * Engine requires manual alterations when varying map size
